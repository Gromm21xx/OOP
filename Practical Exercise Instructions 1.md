## Practical Exercise 1

## Exercise instructions:

1. Create a class called Customer with the following attributes:	
   * **email**: The customer's email address	
   * **total_spent**: The total amount spent by the customer	
   * **membership_length**: The length of the customer's membership in years
2. Define an \__init__ method in the Customer class that takes email, total_spent, and membership_length as parameters and initializes the corresponding attributes.
3. Create a method called get_customer_info in the Customer class that returns a string with the customer's email and total amount spent.
   
   ### **STRETCH**
4. Add a method called get_membership_level in the Customer class that determines the customer's membership level based on the membership_length attribute.
5. Modify the get_customer_info method to include the membership level in the returned string.
6. Instantiate instances of the Customer class with sample data and call the get_customer_info method to print their information.
